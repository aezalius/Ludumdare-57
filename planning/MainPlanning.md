## Ludum Dare 57
### Theme: Depths


### Planning
#### Depths:
- ocean depths
- deep mechanics
- sinking


#### Ocean depths
Less focus on graphics, minor story to kick things off, thalassophobia?

Player is a drone pilot exploring some ocean planet something or other and has a terminal which shows sonar and plays audio from the drone. Game starts with a touchdown of the pod with the pilot, crashing waves sound, and a thunk as the drone(s) is/are dispatched. Could maybe have multiple drones and swap between them. Goal is to make contact with a missing undersea research base or something by docking the drone with them.


#### Technical
Should be able to do the entire game in 2d in godot, run a 2d map in the background and use lighting tricks to fake sonar.
